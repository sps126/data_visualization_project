# Data Visualization Final Project 

For my final project I created a dashboard on recidivism that can be located [here](https://sps126.shinyapps.io/data_viz_final/).

This repository contains the files used to create my final project for data visualization. This project aimed to create a compelling story about a policy issue with little explanation. My project focuses on recidivism.

There are three folders:
* **data**, which has the dataset downloaded from the [NIJ's recidivism challenge](https://nij.ojp.gov/funding/recidivism-forecasting-challenge).
* **code**, which has the R script used to create the shiny app.
* **output**, which has my final report.
